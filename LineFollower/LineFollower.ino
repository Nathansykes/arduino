/* This example uses the line sensors on the Zumo 32U4 to follow
a black line on a white background, using a PID-based algorithm.
It works decently on courses with smooth, 6" radius curves and
has been tested with Zumos using 75:1 HP motors.  Modifications
might be required for it to work well on different courses or
with different motors.

This demo requires a Zumo 32U4 Front Sensor Array to be
connected, and jumpers on the front sensor array must be
installed in order to connect pin 4 to DN4 and pin 20 to DN2. */
